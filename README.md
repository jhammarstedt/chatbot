# Chatbot
Playing around with the tutorial now https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-chatbot-with-python-deep-learning-in-less-than-an-hour-56a063bdfc44

Futher work:
Movie recom system:
I always spend too long selecting movies. So now I'll build one that will help me out!

Functionality:
Will use the tutorial and build it through messenger: 
https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/12/facebook-messenger-bot-python.html

The initial bot should be able to:
- Ask for preference in messenger app
- Filter through genres and IMDB score with their API
- Suggest a movie
- If user has seen the movie, it will run a collaborative filtering model to determine what 
other ppl that likes this movie watches


Further functionality will be added later..
